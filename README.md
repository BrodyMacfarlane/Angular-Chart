Angular Chart
=============

##This is intended to be a helpful resource for those in DevMountain Immersive 3.  

	It would be very much appreciated if you all could help make changes! 
	If you would like to make changes to the chart, please make a pull request and write them below, and I will get to adding your requests.

	Eventually, I plan to add more features to this chart, when needed, so if there are any requests for things I should add, let me know.  I will make this chart as big as needed.


##Sample list of things needed right now (there's so much more):
	-A proper explanation of $http and $q,
	-how to set up modules,
	-how to set up functions,
	-when to use $scope,
	-how to connect all of your script with angular,
	-how to retrieve data from an API,
	-a solid explanation of promises and how their callbacks work,




##ATTENTION: 
=============
I do not claim that all of the information I have on the chart is correct.  If you see something wrong, or that could be phrased more clearly, please report it to the known bugs section, and I will get to fixing that.  


	I hope this chart comes to be a useful tool in our early Angular Development life, and wish you all the best of luck in your applications!
